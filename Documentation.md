# Inspiration 

The brief has given us the option of design or Technical route, to create an app that 
takes into consideration an API key which we will intern use to produce the data we need 
to create the application. We will choose the dependencies to pull from the API to aid in 
which type of application dependant on the application we want to produce then we will 
process then display the information in a way that can be interpreted by the users. 

I created a survey that asks users 10 questions about how and what they use to order or 
choose food and what they feel about certain applications that are used most. 

| Survey Question | Justification |
| ------ | ----------- |
|Do you struggle with choosing where you want to eat?|Users often get stuck with choice paralysis in which they can’t choose a place to eat quickly or at all causing them stress or others.|
|Do you use mobile food applications to help you choose what you want to eat?|Users use delivery services applications to assist them in choosing what they want to eat.|
|How many times a week do you order food or go out to eat?|This could suggest the target audience for such an application. |
|What application do you use most to order food?|Users may like a certain aesthetic of an application or use whatever is available to them due to Deliveroo and UberEATS are mainly in larger towns and cities in the UK|
|How important are restaurants reviews to you?|Reviews are important for users, it could literally decide if you want to eat at a certain restaurant all dependant on good reviews, possible feature of the application. |
|Do you feel like food applications help with choosing where to eat?|if you don’t order food on the application it might help with where you want to go, you might see a dish you want to eat but then you can choose where you want it from or want to go for it.|
|Do you only choose places to eat that you know where they are?|Users may only choose restaurants which they know where they are as its easier just to go instead of researching a location.|
|Would you experiment more with food if you knew the locations of more restaurants?|This question follows on from the previous asking if uses would experiment more with food if they new where the restaurants are as location might influence if they want to try it or not. |
|Would you like a more enjoyable way to choose where you want to eat?|Users may not see the need to use a product that helps them decide on what they want to eat.|
|Do you think food applications need to state allergy information more clearly?|Applications don’t tend to display much information about allergy information on the actual dish.|

The application that will be designed is intended to take the stress out of choosing somewhere to eat.
It will be optimised for local areas or the intent of traveling with people or alone, it will let users 
narrow down the options using a selection of images that feature a range of different cuisines. 

The selection process will mainly use images to narrow the choices of each cuisine until the user feels 
happy with their choice, the pictures will have titles of the food’s origin for example Chinese, Japanese,
American, Italian, French, Indian, Greek, vegan or vegetarian. I want to make to process of choosing what 
to eat more enjoyable or at least less stressful. I want the application to have a final screen that allows 
users to see the details of the restaurant that serves the dish they have selected

For Inspiration I started to look at current popular food applications that users used frequently as well as
researching the best food applications in the current market that are upcoming or booking applications to try
and understand the common trend that they use. I want to incorporate using material design into the applications
as it can be effective when it comes to user experience in applications giving the flow of the site a more natural
feel. 

I took a lot of inspiration from current delivery applications such as Uber Eats(Uber Eats, n.d.) but with only 19%
of the 61 respondents saying they use Uber Eats for a delivery service, it’s still a popular application with links 
to Uber(Uber, n.d.) itself. I will create a web application that is stylish and elegant compared to current web 
applications and I will utilise functionalities of different JavaScript libraries and a range of web programming paradigms
that just allows users to effortlessly choose what they want to eat.

The key in designing a good product is to utilize colours and the material design aesthetic to create something different
for users to use. The application will stay simple due to time constraints and the fact it’s just an application that helps
users with deciding but also informs them on a range of different establishments they can eat at. 

For reference I looked at popular mobile applications that could be developed into having another purpose. Tinder (Tinder, n.d.)
is an already established platform with great functionality that could be tweaked into something innovative for food lovers. In a
survey I created with 10 questions I asked if users use food applications to help choose what they want to eat, with 61 respondents 
and over 73% saying yes.

These are a selection of food applications that are currently most used on the apple store, they all have a similar layout
with only subtle uses of colour with the main colour featured being white which offers contrast to the colour. The colour 
that is used are often softer pastel colours or matte shades rather than bright neon shades of the same colour, this creates
a softer more subtle transition through the application, it would also benefit the users on mobile due to the less radiant 
counterpart colours cause less glare in a low light situation. 


## Wire Frame Concepts

First initial concept was to have multiple cards in a grid, each card would have a different dish from a different country to represent the style of food.
This option has its benefits as you could have a vast range of different dishes on the screen at one time, but the layout is very simple. It can still be
utilised in the same fashion by narrowing down the selection of food for the user after the user touches each card on the screen enlargers to show a larger
image of the dish and the best rated restaurant that sells the dish.

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/wf1.png)

The cards will each have a address on of the restaurant that sells the dish they have chosen with a rating system the user can 
use to remember if they decide to go back, the application will reset the destinations each time it is closed and reopened to 
add variation to the application. 

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/wf2.png)

This concept flows better then the first original concept, but it would take more screens in general to narrow down the food selection due to the fact the 
cards are a variety of sizes. The narrow partitions between each card combined with an elegant font will create the minimal yet stylish design for users to
use and understand. This design took inspiration from the web page on uber eats with the type of dish over the top of the dish itself but a more refined 
version to suit the applications overall style. 

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/wf3.png)

The cards size would be different on each screen to create an elegant puzzle to the application which also impact the user to feel like its meant to be a 
more enjoyable process of choosing somewhere to eat. Each image on the card will be clear and high-quality images from a free stock image website to
represent the food but not the actual dishes themselves.

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/wf4.png)

This concept will have an integrated scroll gallery that will display types of dishes similar casino fruit machine which will allow users  scroll through 
and then click the dish and bring up information on the dish such as nearest restaurant that serves it and allergy information in a range of well thought
out layers that will be layered on top of each other. Using material design to give the application depth.

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/wf5.png)

The menus that will slide out of the original stock image will be have subtle colour codes depending on the dish’s main ingredient such as meat, fish, 
vegan and vegetarian. The dish menus will also have codes that will suggest allergy information such as nuts, shellfish, milk or eggs.

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/wf6.png)

Meal cards stacked on top of each other with the allergy information, the user will be able to swipe through the meals until they find one, they
like the best, the cards will be colour co-ordinated dependant ingredients. Meat dishes will be red, fish will be blue, vegan will be green, and 
vegetarian will be orange, the cards will also have symbols that represent allergies such as shellfish, gluten, milk, egg or nuts.

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/wf7.png)

This idea took inspiration from tinder, utilizing the swipe feature to choose a a dish. Once the card has been chosen the user will 
click the card to enlarge it and it will give details on the closet restaurant that sells the dish including the information regarding
the meal’s contents. 

The card can be then swiped or liked if a user likes the card it will give ask the user to open their google maps or apple maps with a
route to the chosen restaurant.

## Hi-Fidelity Wire Frames

This mock-up of the first wireframe idea, the tiled wireframe and the scroll bar wireframe. The application would have 3 different 
scrolling bars the user swipes up or down on until they find the dish they want. 

The cards will represent a different food category of places to eat dependant on what the user wants to choose, the initial will 
be types, then then second screen of each type will have different dishes or styles of dish that flip over to give a user a address 
of the restaurant of establishment which sells it.

The backside of the cards will be slate similar to current modern restaurants who serve dishes on them.

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/idea1.png)

This tile mock-up will be made of tiles that display multiple different food types for users to choose from. The tiles will overturn 
each time a user presses one to then finally give the user an address of the nearest restaurant that sells that dish.

The tile size will be random to fit the screen with random dishes that will change frequently to add variation to the application 
each time the user opens it up.

![](https://github.com/Wooodzy/App/blob/master/Idea%202.png)

Inspired by tinder, the meat card for the card wireframes, with allergy information on the front, using an elegant font face to 
create a modern feel with the use of pastel colours and shadows to add depth to the application.  

Easy to understand cards that will let users swipe left or right on dishes that they want to choose. The application will reset 
every time its closed so the user can swipe each time they are hungry or can’t decide what they want to eat.

If a user chooses a card it will open up the users mobile mapping application and give them a route to the application.
